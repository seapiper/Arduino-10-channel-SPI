# SPI Example - StretchSense Sensing Circuit - Arduino/Genuino 101

StretchSense is a global supplier of soft sensors. These soft sensors are perfect for measuring the complex movements of people and soft objects in our environments. 

## About
### Background
The SPI Example - StretchSense Sensing Circuit - Arduino/Genuino 101, has been developed to demonstrate how to establish a SPI connection between the StretchSense Sensing Circuit and an Arduino/Genuino 101. 
The example was developed using Arduino IDE v1.6.9
This project and additional examples are available on StretchSense's Github Page http://github.com/Stretchsense-Limited.

### Usage
The SPI Example - StretchSense Sensing Circuit - Arduino/Genuino 101 can be opened within the Arduino IDE and uploaded to a connected Arduino 101 device. 

## Compatible Devices

### Arduino
This library has been developed for the Arduino/Genuino 101, other Arduino products may require changing of GPIO pins and/or changes to the Serial or SPI initialisation. 

### StretchSense
Only the StretchSense Sensing Circuit is compatible with this example project.
